#           Fix simsimd ImportError for Ubuntu 24 Docker Containers
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script resolves the "ImportError: libmvec-2-06864e43.28.so: cannot open
# shared object file" that can occur when trying to install e.g. Nunchaku and 
# PulID nodes.
# This error occurs because a pre-compiled Python package, simsimd, is 
# incompatible with the system libraries inside the Ubuntu 24 Docker container.
# It forces pip to reinstall the 'simsimd' package from its source code. 
# This ensures it's compiled against the correct system libraries within the 
# container. This script is built to be easily tweaked to force any package to
# be built from source, see PACKAGE_TO_FIX in Configuration.
#
# This script is designed to be run inside your ComfyUI Docker container.
# 
# WARNING: RUN THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK. NO WARRANTY GIVEN. NO SUPPORT.
